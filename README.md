🚀 Exploring PandasAI: A New Approach to Data Science!

I've been eager to work on a project that combines Data Science, Machine Learning, and Large Language Models, so I decided to take on a regression challenge from Kaggle using PandasAI!

What is PandasAI?
PandasAI is a Python platform that makes it easy to ask questions to your data in natural language. It helps non-technical users to interact with their data in a more natural way, and it helps technical users to save time, and effort when working with data.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts calories burned during a workout based on various biological metrics.

🔍 My approach is divided into three key parts:
📌 Part 1: Data Loading & Analysis
* Importing the dataset
* Statistical analysis
* Data visualizations

⚙️ Part 2: Data Preprocessing
* Handling outliers
* Encoding categorical features
* Splitting data into train/test sets
* Scaling the data

📊 Part 3: Modeling & Evaluation
* Training and evaluating four well-known regression models

Key Takeaways on PandasAI
✅ I used GPT-3.5-powered PandasAI throughout the project to assist with various tasks.
✅ In my experience, PandasAI is a great tool for those with strong theoretical knowledge of Data Science but limited technical expertise.
❗ However, for experienced Data Scientists proficient in both theory and implementation, working with LLMs can sometimes be challenging and time-consuming.
